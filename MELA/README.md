## MELA (Machine Learning-Enhanced Automata Learning) Approach

The MELA approach is a method for deriving state machine models for network-based systems with time-series inputs and outputs. It uses machine learning (ML) to abstract raw numeric data into discrete intervals that directly correlate with the system states. This approach is particularly effective in handling network systems that analyze continuous and numeric properties of network traffic flows to detect security attacks.

## Testbed

Our testbed simulates a real-world deployment of network routers equipped with an advanced intrusion detection system, focusing on understanding and documenting the behavior of these routers at a system level. It involves generating network flows simulating both normal and attack scenarios, capturing outputs of the system, and converting these time-series data into a set of traces for automata learning. This setup provides a comprehensive environment for evaluating the MELA approach under varied network conditions and attack simulations.
